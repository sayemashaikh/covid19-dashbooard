<h1 align="center">COVID-19 in India Dashboard with Tableau</h1>

This Tableau project provides a detailed analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic's impact in India. It covers various aspects, including state-wise cases and deaths, vaccination statistics, testing details, and age-group-wise data.  


## 🎯 **Project Objectives**  
- Visualize the spread of COVID-19 across Indian states.  
- Analyze vaccination progress by vaccine type, doses administered, and age groups.  
- Provide insights into testing efforts and availability of testing labs across states.  


## 🛠️ **Features and Insights**  

1. **Total Deaths by State**  
   - Visual representation of COVID-19 fatalities across Indian states.  

2. **COVID Cases by State**  
   - State-wise distribution of confirmed COVID-19 cases, highlighting the most affected regions.  

3. **First vs. Second Dose Administered**  
   - Comparison of first and second doses of vaccines administered across states.  

4. **Doses Administered by Vaccine**  
   - Breakdown of doses administered based on vaccine type (e.g., Covaxin, Covishield, Sputnik V).  

5. **Age Group Details**  
   - Analysis of vaccination data segmented by different age groups.  

6. **ICMR Testing Labs by State**  
   - Count of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) approved testing laboratories in each state.  

7. **State-Wise Testing Details**  
   - Insights into the number of COVID-19 tests conducted in each state, showcasing the testing efforts.

The dashboard includes the following visualizations:  
- **Bar Charts**: State-wise COVID cases, deaths, and testing details.  
- **Pie Charts**: Vaccine distribution and doses administered by type.  
- **Maps**: Geographical distribution of COVID-19 cases, deaths, and testing labs.  
- **Line Graphs**: Trends in first and second dose administration over time.  


## 📂 **Dataset Overview**  
The dataset used contains comprehensive information on COVID-19 in India, including:  
- State-wise COVID cases and deaths  
- Vaccination details (doses, vaccine type, age groups)  
- ICMR testing labs  
- Testing statistics by state  


## 🚀 **Key Learnings**
